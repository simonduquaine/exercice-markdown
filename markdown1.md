## Short story

Widely used to make readme files or even on online forums, it's simple to understand ans works pretty well.  
Easy to use, it has been used since 2004 and is well supported in numerous websites around the WWW.<br/>

## Overview and requirements
1. Overview
   
   Markdown can be transcprited into HTML and has the same results for text editing but again, it's heckin' simple to write readme files into `.md` than into `.html`. 

2. Requirements
   
   As every coding language you need a computer (big brain time here) and a IDE that can support `.md` files but don't worry on it as most of them do as they are really convenient for readme files.  
   Here is a nice IDE to download in the [links](#useful-links) provided.
