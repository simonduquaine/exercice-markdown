## Short story

Widely used to make readme files or even on online forums, it's simple to understand ans works pretty well.  
Easy to use, it has been used since 2004 and is well supported in numerous websites around the WWW.<br/>

## Overview and requirements
1. Overview
   
   Markdown can be transcprited into HTML and has the same results for text editing but again, it's heckin' simple to write readme files into `.md` than into `.html`. 

2. Requirements
   
   As every coding language you need a computer (big brain time here) and a IDE that can support `.md` files but don't worry on it as most of them do as they are really convenient for readme files.  
   Here is a nice IDE to download in the [links](#useful-links) provided.

## What is Markdown?  
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.  
Created by [John Gruber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber) and [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.  

## Why use MarkDown ?
You might be wondering why people use MarkDown? There are many reasons!  
- MarkDown can be used for everything (websites, documents, notes, books and so on).  
- MarkDown is portable. It can be open in any MarkDown application without any problem.
- MarkDown is platform independent.
- MarkDown is future proof. It means that even if the application you are using is shut down at some point in the future, you'll still be able to open it with another text editor that supports it.
- MarkDown is everywhere.

# What is Markdown?
**Markdown** is a text editing and formatting system; it is both a syntax, a text → HTML conversion script and a file format. It is commonly used for project or dataset documentation files - often named readme.md. It is stored in classic text format and is lighter than its interpreted version since it does not contain html tags.

The philosophy of the system is that the written text is readable without a particular interpreter in text mode. It is light and uncluttered with most of the verbosity of a marked-up language. Syntax elements are punctuation characters that make sense visually even when unconverted. Once converted, the web browser (which then acts as an interpreter) will make it easier to read.

# A little history...
This language was created in 2004 by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz and has not evolved since. Even if many extensions and “extras” were added to the original project.

From the start, Gruber wrote a Perl script to convert markdown text to XHTML. This is all the interest of the system: edit a simple text file with some additional special characters, then pass it in a script which will enrich it with the tags required to display it formatted in the browser.
