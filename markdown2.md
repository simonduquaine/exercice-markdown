# The syntax of Markdown:
## The titles
There are two syntaxes for titles. They produce the same result, so you can use either one. Just try to be consistent across your documents.

The underline method allows two levels of title. Your line of text must be underlined by two or more characters - without upper limit. The = for a title 1 and the - for a title 2.

It is also possible to titrate by adding sharps at the beginning of the line. There is then no limit to the number of title levels that can be used (but do not go beyond 7).

## The paragraphs
To view a paragraph, skip two lines and type its text. A single line break corresponds to a carriage return and not to a change of paragraph.
